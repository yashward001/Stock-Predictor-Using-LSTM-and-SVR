# Stock Trend Analysis Project

## Overview
This project shifts the traditional focus of predictive models in stock trading from attempting to predict exact future prices to understanding and predicting general price tendencies or actions. This approach is particularly suited to the unpredictable nature of the stock market, influenced by a myriad of unforeseeable economic factors. 

## Problem Statement
Predictive models that aim to forecast precise stock prices are highly vulnerable to market volatility and external shocks, often leading to substantial forecast errors and potential financial losses. Our project addresses this issue by developing models that focus on identifying general trends and cyclic behavior in stock prices, thereby providing a strategic decision-making tool for investors. How can we leverage machine learning models to predict general trends in NASDAQ stock prices?

## Objectives
- To understand and predict general market trends and cyclical behaviors.
- To equip investors with a robust tool for strategic decision-making that emphasizes risk mitigation.
- To minimize the reliance on exact price forecasts and reduce the potential for significant forecast errors.

## Models Used
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: Demonstrates high accuracy in tracking actual price movements, reflected by strong correlation with actual prices, and similar trends in rolling mean comparisons.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Offers insights into market direction with a conservative estimate of price trends.

## Results
Our analyses indicate that the LSTM model is highly capable of capturing the underlying patterns and trends in stock price data. It is complemented by the SVR model, which provides additional perspectives on market direction.

## Conclusion
The project successfully fulfills the objective of shifting focus towards trend analysis rather than precise price prediction. It presents a data-driven, strategic approach for investment decision-making in the stock market.
